## 4. Results {#results}

When all 4 nets are compared against BnH in figure \ref{fig:performance}, we observe that the FFN performs slightly better than BnH, whilst the other 3 nets are not better or even equal.
When we look closer, the decision of feedforward in (Letter A \ref{fig:performance}) is crucial to the performance. If this return would be predicted negative, the performance would be worse than BnH. 

Further, the decision in (Letter B \ref{fig:performance}) almost brought the performance back to buy and hold.
Notice the very short timeframe, to see if that model continuously outperforms BnH we ought to test the model on multiple in- and out-of-samples and cumulate their performance.


Thus, it can be clearly said, that the benefit in the performance in this particular example is most likely generated randomly.
